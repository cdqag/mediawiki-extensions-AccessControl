== Instalation == 
For very very quick start add the following to LocalSettings.php:

 wf


== Config ==
First you set allow action 'view' for all users:

 $wgGroupPermissions['*']['read']            = true;

An next deny access for unauthorized users for actions:

 $wgGroupPermissions['*']['createaccount']   = false;
 $wgGroupPermissions['*']['edit']            = false;
 $wgGroupPermissions['*']['writeapi']        = false;
 $wgGroupPermissions['*']['createpage'] = false;
 $wgGroupPermissions['*']['createtalk'] = false;
 $wgGroupPermissions['*']['edit'] = false;
 $wgGroupPermissions['*']['createpage'] = false;

 // If you have installed Extension:LookupUser
 $wgGroupPermissions['*']['lookupuser'] = false;

 // If you have installed Extension:ProofreadPage
 $wgGroupPermissions['*']['pagetranslation'] = false;

3, Try access by transclusion self-protected page into another page

4, Try create self-protect template and use it
